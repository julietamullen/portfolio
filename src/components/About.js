            <p>Hi there! &#x1f44b; I'm a self taught software development student based in Argentina.</p>
            <p>Former bartender, a while ago I started learning about JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I found this development world incredibly interesting, and kept the learning going.</p>
            <p>Currently, I'm getting into ReactJS and would like to learn React Native in the future. I would also love to handle new technologies and improve my practices to make my projects more accesible to everyone!</p>
            <p>I've got knowledge about <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>ReactJS</b>, but I'm eager to use other tools as well!</p>
            <p>Other than that, I really enjoy embroidering and languajes (learning japanese at the moment, and dreaming about visiting Japan one day!). </p>
